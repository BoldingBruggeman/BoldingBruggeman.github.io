**What**: A best practices workshop using GOTM/FABM

**Where**: Middelfart, Denmark

**When**: 2-6 September 2019

**Why**:
GOTM/FABM is a comprehensive open source modelling system for studying natural waters, used all over the world by master- and PhD-students as well as post-docs and scientists.
It combines a state-of-the-art model for water column hydrodynamics and turbulence (GOTM) with a flexible, extensible system for modelling aquatic biogeochemistry and ecology (FABM).
This workshop will provide an in-depth overview of the GOTM/FABM system, covering everyday use (compilation, set-up), advance tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis, and
development of new functionality, including new biogeochemical models. The emphasis will lie on best practices for working with the modelling system - practices we have obtained
during decades of active involvement in the development and application of GOTM/FABM. The workshop will adress both the new user as well as the more experienced modeller.
The workshop will discuss both marine and limnological applications.

Format: The workshop will alternate between short presentations and hands-on sessions. It will go through all steps involved in creating a solid model set-up. Some work will be carried out in small groups. 

Participants are expected to bring their own laptop and all information they intend to use for their location of interest (specifics to follow).
It is the aim that participants will leave with a well-calibrated model setup ready for further use and analysis.

For the code development session, participants must have a working Fortran compiler installed to get the full benefit (evaluation versions of the Intel compiler can be installed on Windows - on Mac and Linux gcc is available). GOTM/FABM is platform-independent: users with Windows, Mac and Linux will have the same options.

**Important**: Please register to the workshop by sending an email to karsten@bolding-bruggeman.com no later than January 15. 2019. In order to proceed with the planning of the workshop we want to be sure there is sufficient interest (20 participants is the minimum). Registration by email is regarded as definitive commitment.

Below a preliminary program is provided. Additional information will be provided if we reach a minimum number of 20 participants.
